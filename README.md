Welcome to the software that powers the LED light display on the front of the
Infolab.

If you're here to write an effect for the display, have a play around with [The
Playground](https://infolab21-lights.lancs.ac.uk/playground).

When you've written your effect, fork the repo and add the effect as a js file
alongside the others in [web/priv/js_effects/](web/priv/js_effects/), then
submit a PR!

## Rules

If you're submitting an effect, please make sure it follows these rules:

1. Effects must not display explicit/ offensive content.
2. Effects must not fetch external resources.

For obvious reasons, PRs containing effects that violate these restrictions will
be rejected.
